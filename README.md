# Hacking + Cyber

## How does the internet work ?

- **Questions to the audience :**
	+ What is the internet ? Where does your data flow ?
	+ Who's in charge of the internet ?
	+ How can you get in touch with anyone around the globe no matter which ISP ?

- **A distributed network :**
	+ built to survive a nuclear attack (ARPANET, Paul Baran, 1970)
	+ A sum of millions of interconnected networks
	+ (IP) Like a worldwide postal service, or rather a telegraph on steroids because it's dealing with zeros and ones. We are all giver addresses known as IP addresses that are linked to the place we are connected to.
	+ (TCP) Information (video, text, song, images...) is split into very small packets. The real power of the internet, the game changing technology, is to be able to send those little packets through different routes at the same time and ensure that the will reach their destination in the right order.
	+ A packet contains a header with it source and destination, so that it can navigate independently on the network.
	+ Routers are dedicated computers (like your own wifi router at home) accross the network that are responsible for directing packets to their destination through the optimal path (shortest, but also less crowded and stuff)
	
- 99% of the data flows in cables
